# Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI

**Week 1 | Proficiency: A2 (Beginner) | Duration: ~90 minutes | Hardware: None Required**

Welcome to the beginning of your Physical AI journey. This chapter establishes the conceptual foundation for everything that follows—understanding what makes AI in the physical world fundamentally different from the digital AI you may already know.

## What You'll Learn

By completing this chapter, you will be able to:

1. **Explain the difference** between digital AI and Physical AI
2. **Describe the Sim-to-Real challenge** and why it matters
3. **Identify key technologies** in the Physical AI stack (ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac, VLA)
4. **Articulate why humanoid robots** excel in human-centered environments

## Chapter Structure

| Lesson | Title | Duration | Focus |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|
| 1 | [The Paradigm Shift](./01-paradigm-shift.md) | 25 min | Digital AI vs Physical AI |
| 2 | [The Reality Gap](./02-reality-gap.md) | 20 min | Sim-to-Real challenge |
| 3 | [The Technology Stack](./03-technology-stack.md) | 25 min | ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac, VLA |
| 4 | [Why Humanoids](./04-why-humanoids.md) | 20 min | Humanoid advantages |

## Prerequisites

- **Python fundamentals**: Variables, functions, classes, basic async concepts
- **No robotics experience required**: This chapter is your introduction
- **No hardware needed**: All content is conceptual

## How This Chapter Fits

This is **Part 1, Week 1** of a 13-week journey. Here's where you're headed:

```
Part 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)     ← You are here
Part 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
Part 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)
Part 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
```

This chapter gives you the "why" before Parts 2-4 show you the "how."

## Teaching Approach

This chapter uses **Layer 1 teaching**: direct explanation to build your mental model first. Each lesson ends with a "Try With AI" activity where you'll explore concepts using an AI assistant (like ChatGPT).

No code execution required—this is purely conceptual content to establish the foundation for hands-on work in later chapters.
