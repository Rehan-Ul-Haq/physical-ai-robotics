# Part 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

**Weeks 1-5 | Hardware: Simulation Only**

---

## What You'll Learn

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is the **nervous system** of modern robots—the middleware that connects sensors, actuators, and AI into a unified, intelligent system. Just as the human nervous system transmits signals between brain and body, ROS 2 enables communication between robot components.

By the end of Part 1, you will:

- **Understand Physical AI** — The paradigm shift from digital AI to embodied intelligence
- **Master ROS 2 fundamentals** — Workspaces, packages, nodes, and the build system
- **Implement communication patterns** — Topics, Services, and Actions for robot coordination
- **Apply advanced concepts** — Lifecycle nodes, QoS policies, launch files, and parameters
- **Build your first robot application** — A complete multi-node system in simulation

## Chapter Overview

| Chapter | Title | Week | Key Topics |
|---------|-------|------|------------|
| 1 | Introduction to Physical AI | 1 | Paradigm shift, Sim-to-Real, technology stack |
| 2 | ROS 2 Fundamentals | 2 | Installation, workspaces, packages, nodes |
| 3 | ROS 2 Communication Patterns | 3 | Topics, Services, Actions |
| 4 | ROS 2 Advanced Concepts | 4 | Lifecycle, QoS, launch files, parameters |
| 5 | Building Your First Robot | 5 | Integration, debugging, deployment |

## The Nervous System Analogy

Understanding ROS 2 is easier when you think of it like a nervous system:

| Human Nervous System | ROS 2 Equivalent |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Sensory neurons | Sensor nodes (camera, LiDAR, IMU) |
| Motor neurons | Actuator nodes (motors, grippers) |
| Neural pathways | Topics (data streams) |
| Reflex arcs | Services (request/response) |
| Complex behaviors | Actions (long-running tasks) |

Just as your nervous system coordinates billions of signals, ROS 2 orchestrates the complex dance of robot perception and action.

## Hardware Requirements

Part 1 works entirely in simulation. You need:

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (or WSL2 on Windows)
- 16GB RAM minimum
- Any modern CPU
- No GPU required
