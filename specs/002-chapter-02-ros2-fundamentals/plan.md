# Chapter 2: ROS 2 Fundamentals — Lesson Plan

**Generated by**: chapter-planner v2.0.0 (Reasoning-Activated)
**Created**: 2025-11-28

## Executive Summary

6-lesson reasoning-activated plan teaching ROS 2 fundamentals through Layer 1 (manual foundation) and Layer 2 (AI collaboration).

### Design Decisions

- **6 Lessons**: Justified by 20 core concepts + 6 user scenarios (concept-density driven, not arbitrary template)
- **Hands-on discovery**: Execute commands FIRST, observe output, then understand (differs from Chapter 1)
- **Layer progression**: Lessons 1-3 (Manual, no AI) → Lessons 4-6 (AI with Three Roles framework)
- **A2 proficiency**: All lessons 2-5 concepts (respects 5-7 concept limit)
- **Three Roles invisible**: Framework demonstrated through action, never exposed as meta-commentary

## Lesson Breakdown

### Layer 1: Manual Foundation (No AI)

**Lesson 1**: What is ROS 2 and Why Robots Need Middleware (45 min)
- Concepts: 3 (ROS middleware, problems solved, ROS vs OS)
- Modality: Problem-solution framing, mental model
- Maps to: LO-01, User Story 1

**Lesson 2**: Installing ROS 2 Humble (60 min)
- Concepts: 2 (Humble distribution, environment setup)
- Modality: Hands-on discovery (execute → observe → understand)
- Maps to: LO-02, User Story 2

**Lesson 3**: Exploring ROS 2 Graph with CLI (90 min)
- Concepts: 5 (Nodes, topics, topic direction, services, graph)
- Modality: CLI exploration with turtlesim
- Maps to: LO-04, User Story 3

### Layer 2: AI Collaboration (Three Roles Framework)

**Lesson 4**: Create Your First Python Node (120 min)
- Concepts: 4 (rclpy init, Node class, spinning, callbacks)
- Three Roles: Teacher (callbacks), Student (logging), Convergence (error handling)
- Maps to: LO-03, User Story 4

**Lesson 5**: Publisher-Subscriber Pattern (150 min)
- Concepts: 5 (Publisher, subscriber, message types, topic naming, queue size)
- Three Roles: Teacher (queue size), Student (optimization), Convergence (debugging)
- Maps to: LO-05, User Story 5

**Lesson 6**: Services (Request-Response) (120 min)
- Concepts: 3 (Service concept, server, client)
- Three Roles: Teacher (async), Student (sync/async), Convergence (timing)
- Maps to: LO-06, User Story 6

## Cognitive Load Management

**Concepts per Lesson**: [3] [2] [5] | [4] [5] [3]

All stay within A2 limit of 7. Peak lessons (3, 5) at 5 concepts.

## Constitutional Compliance Checklist

✅ Concept density drives lesson count
✅ Layer progression clear (L1→L2)
✅ Hands-on discovery modality throughout
✅ Three Roles demonstrated (all L2 lessons)
✅ Cognitive load respects A2 limits
✅ Specification primacy (WHAT before HOW)
✅ Hardware tier explicit (Simulation Only)
✅ All success criteria mapped
✅ All learning objectives covered
✅ All user scenarios addressed
✅ Anti-convergence applied

## Implementation Notes

Each lesson implements: Specification → Hands-On Activity → Understanding → Assessment → Exploration

Layer 2 lessons include "Try With AI" sections demonstrating all Three Roles through action (not meta-commentary).
